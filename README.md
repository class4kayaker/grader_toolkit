Non-Dimensional Parameter Calculation Script
====

For many problems with mathematical descriptions, it is possible to classify
the probable behaviour by examining a non-dimensional parameter formulated from
the provided dimensional (with units) constants.

Frequently it is desirable to quickly and accurately identify what values these
have for a given problem parameter definition file supplied to a scientific
code.

The current script is obtains both the values of the source constants and the
values of the non-dimensional parameters B, Ra for a specific case of Aspect
parameter files for a density stratified problem.
